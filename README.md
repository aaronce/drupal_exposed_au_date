drupal_exposed_au_date
======================

for Drupal 7, Views 3.
Please see module code comments for more dependencies

Due to some formatting complications when setting up a View in Drupal with an exposed filter of field type of "Date", This small module will allows for some modifications to allow other date formats except for the default of "yyyy-mm-dd"

Example provided in this module to set to "dd/mm/yyyy"
